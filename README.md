<h1>KIRBY: An Antenna Far-Field Pattern Visualization Tool</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The Antenna Far-Field Pattern Visualization GUI is a software application that allows users to visualize far-field patterns of antennas. The GUI is capable of reading and converting data from four different types of documents (CST, Feko, RFX, Echoless chamber) into a proprietary "KIRBY" Excel file format, which can then be used for analysis.

The GUI offers various visualization options, including 3D spherical and Cartesian plots, azimuth and elevation cuts, and other features that enable users to explore the behavior far-field. The interface is designed to be user-friendly, making it accessible to a broad range of users, regardless of their technical expertise.

Overall, the Antenna Far-Field Pattern Visualization GUI is a useful tool for engineers, scientists, and researchers who need to analyze antenna far-field patterns. Its ability to provide advanced visualization and analysis capabilities for this type of data can help users make informed decisions and develop more effective antenna designs.
